BlueZone-Scripts-Installer
==========================
This installer is a simple Windows Form which will download and configure the most recent version of DHS' BlueZone Scripts.

It's done using vb.net, using Visual Studio 2013. I've chosen this method as it involves the least work for my users, save for maybe a web application (which would be challenging for my employer to implement at this point). As a Windows Form, it will not install software on the users' computers (thus bypassing UAC issues). Contributions welcome!

Thank you!
