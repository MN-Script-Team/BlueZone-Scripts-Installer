BlueZone-Scripts-Installer
==========================
This installer is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript form which will configure the most recent version of DHS' BlueZone Scripts (for MAXIS and PRISM), and export it to a zip file for easy installation in your agency.

As a web form, it will not install software on the users' computers. It has been tested in Internet Explorer (v11), as well as Edge, Google Chrome, and Firefox.

Contributions are welcome! Please see the installer issue list if you have questions or want to contribute.
